# Refinify Mac Deployment Context

## Session Summary (2025-07-31)

### Issues Fixed

1. **hs.dialog.chooseFromList Error**
   - Error: `attempt to call a nil value (field 'chooseFromList')`
   - Cause: `hs.dialog.chooseFromList` doesn't exist in Hammerspoon
   - Fix: Replaced with `hs.chooser` API which is the correct way to create interactive choice lists
   - Location: `refinify-hammerspoon/refinify.lua:376`

2. **File Loading Error**
   - Error: `attempt to index a nil value (local 'file')` at line 33
   - Cause: No null check when `io.open` returns nil for missing files
   - Fix: Added fallback paths and null checks for both `loadSystemPrompt` and `loadConfigurationFromFile`
   - Now checks multiple locations (relative path, app bundle path) before failing gracefully

3. **System Prompt Not Being Used**
   - Issue: System prompt from `system-prompt-completion.md` wasn't affecting output
   - Cause: Mac implementation was using nested object structure for system message content
   - Fix: Changed from `content: [{type: "text", text: "..."}]` to simple `content: "..."`
   - Added debug logging to verify prompt loading

### Key Changes Made

1. **refinify-hammerspoon/refinify.lua**:
   - Replaced `hs.dialog.chooseFromList` with `hs.chooser` implementation
   - Added file existence checks and fallback paths
   - Simplified OpenAI API payload structure for system prompt
   - Added debug logging for troubleshooting

2. **Build Process**:
   - Successfully built Mac app using `build-mac-app.sh`
   - Created distributable `Refinify-1.0.0-mac.zip`
   - App includes all necessary resources and templates

### Git Configuration

- Fixed commit author from "Moisei Rabinovich" to "moisei"
- Set email to GitHub noreply address: `moisei-dev@users.noreply.github.com`
- Configuration command: `git config user.email "moisei-dev@users.noreply.github.com"`

### Testing Notes

- Configuration dialog now works properly with `hs.chooser`
- File loading handles missing files gracefully with fallback options
- System prompt is now properly loaded and used in API requests
- Debug messages can be viewed in Hammerspoon console
